> **‚ö†Ô∏è Newly Released Mod - Buyer Beware!**  
> This is a **recently released modification project** that transforms grinders into smart grind-by-weight systems. While functional and free/open source, it's should be considered an **experimental mod** that requires technical skill to build and may have rough edges. **Build at your own risk** !


The Smart Grind-by-Weight is a user-friendly, touch interface-driven, highly accurate open source grinder modification that can transforms any grinder (with a accesable motor relay) into an intelligent grind-by-weight system. Originally developed for the Eureka Mignon Specialita, the system can be easily adapted for other grinders.

**The concept is simple:** Perform a "brain swap" on your grinder. Replace the original controller with our intelligent ESP32-S3 controller and add a precision load cell to the mix.

**Upgrade cost:** ‚Ç¨30-40 in parts  
**Target accuracy:** ¬±0.03g tolerance  
**No regrets**: No permanent modifications, and original grind-by-time mode is also available

## ‚ú® Features

- **User-friendly interface** with 3 profiles: Single, Double, Custom
- **Beautiful display** with simple graphics or detailed charts (easily switchable)
- **High accuracy**: ¬±0.03g error tolerance  
- **Zero-shot learning**: Algorithm adapts instantly to any grind size, bean setting, humidity etc. without manual tuning
- **Original timed run preserved** ‚Äì there is a setting to enable the original Grind-By-Time mode
- **BLE OTA updates** for firmware
- **Advanced analytics** using BLE data transfer and Python Streamlit reports
- **For Eureka**: No permanent modifications needed - just swap the screen and add 3D printed parts

## üß† Intelligent Grinding Algorithm

Our predictive grinding system uses a zero-shot learning approach that adapts to any conditions:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  start((Start Grind)) --> T[TARING]
  T --> E[PREDICTIVE<br/>learn latency & flow_rate<br/>compute motor_stop_target_weight]
  E --> S[SETTLING]
  S --> P[PULSE<br/>bounded pulse using effective_flow_rate]
  P -->|abs_error <= tolerance OR error < 0 OR pulses >= max| C[COMPLETED]
  P -->|needs more| S
```

**Key Innovation:** The algorithm learns grind latency and flow rate in real-time, then uses predictive control to stop just before the target weight, followed by precision pulses to reach exact accuracy. No manual tuning required.

## üìù Personal Note

My goal with this project was to get real-life experience coding with AI agents. The code reflects that learning journey. I've learned a lot, and ultimately I'm in awe of how fast you can produce results with AI assistance. 

What I've learned so far is that "vibe coding" with AI is great for POCs and testing theories. But afterward you must pivot and reimplement features while keeping a close eye on the architecture the AI produces. Otherwise you'll get stuck at dead ends that require painful refactoring (been there, done that). 

In this project, that's most obvious when at state management - it's a bit cluttered in places. I'm very happy with the end result and I'm releasing the project as is. It eliminates grind weight variability from the espresso equation, bringing you one step closer to dialing in perfect shots.

**Project Status**: This project is shared 'as-is' and I have limited availability for support. While I'm happy to share what I've built, please understand that troubleshooting and feature requests may receive limited attention.
