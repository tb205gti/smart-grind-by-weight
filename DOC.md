## üîå Installation & Wiring

[<img src="media/wiring_diagram.png" alt="Wiring Diagram" width="50%">](media/wiring_diagram.png)

### Pin Configuration

**HX711 Load Cell Amplifier Connections:**
```
ESP32-S3 GPIO 2    ‚Üí    HX711 SCK
ESP32-S3 GPIO 3    ‚Üí    HX711 DOUT
ESP32-S3 3.3V      ‚Üí    HX711 VCC
ESP32-S3 GND       ‚Üí    HX711 GND
```

**Load Cell to HX711 Wiring:**
```
Load Cell           HX711
Red (E+)         ‚Üí  E+
Black (E-)       ‚Üí  E-
White (A-)       ‚Üí  A-
Green (A+)       ‚Üí  A+
Yellow (Shield)  ‚Üí  GND
```

- Connect the load cell shield wire (usually yellow) to the HX711 GND
- The HX711 only has 1 GND pin - solder the shield wire to the backside of the pin header
- **Tip**: Keep the load cell wire as short as possible to reduce noise

**Eureka Mignon Connections:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL WARNING:** Always verify your specific Eureka's wiring independently! Wire colors vary between units and cannot be trusted. Use the numbered pin positions shown in the reference image.

Using the 4-pin Eureka plug pinout (see `media/4-pin_Eureka_plug_pinout.png`), counting from left to right with the plug oriented with 'ribs' towards you:

[<img src="media/4-pin_Eureka_plug_pinout.png" alt="4-Pin Eureka Plug Pinout" width="50%">](media/4-pin_Eureka_plug_pinout.png)

```
ESP32-S3 5V        ‚Üí    Pin 1 (5V power)
                        Pin 2 (Button signal - not used in this project)
ESP32-S3 GPIO 18   ‚Üí    Pin 3 (Motor control signal)
ESP32-S3 GND       ‚Üí    Pin 4 (Ground)
```

**4-Pin Eureka Plug Reference (Left to Right):**
- **Pin 1**: 5V power supply
- **Pin 2**: Button signal (unused in this project)  
- **Pin 3**: Motor control signal
- **Pin 4**: Ground

‚ö†Ô∏è **VERIFY 5V:** Use a multimeter to confirm 5V pin - wire colors vary between units! The Waveshare board has reverse polarity protection, and button/motor wires can be swapped without risk of damage.

### Installation Steps

1. **Flash the firmware** on the Waveshare board (see Firmware Instructions below)
2. **Add the 1000ŒºF capacitor** between 5V and ground (protects against brownouts)
3. **Create HX711 to Waveshare connection:**
   - Add angled pin headers to HX711 (VCC, GND, DOUT, SCK pins)
   - Connect dupont cables to Waveshare board
   - Load cell can be directly soldered to HX711 (Make the wires as short as possible. Connect shield wire as well to GND)
4. **For Eureka Mignon assembly:**
   - Disassemble top plate and front plate
   - Remove the button and store it (not needed)
   - Use JST-PH plug to connect to Waveshare board
   - **WARNING:** Wire colors vary significantly between Eureka units - always verify pin functions with a multimeter before connecting!
   - Mount Waveshare screen using 3D printed adapter where original screen was (the Waveshare screen with adapter replaces the original screen and reuses the original mounting screws)
   - Fish HX711 wire through housing, exit via button hole
   - Mount load cell and HX711 to 3D printed back plate
   - Clip 3D printed back plate onto Eureka Mignon
   - Connect plug to HX711
   - Add 3D printed cover plate and screw down
   - Add 3D printed dosing cup holder on load cell and screw down
   - Hide screws with 3D printed screw covers
5. **Calibrate load cell** (see [Initial Calibration](#Ô∏è-initial-calibration))

## ‚öñÔ∏è Initial Calibration

After flashing firmware, calibrate the load cell for accurate measurements:

1. **Access calibration**: Settings ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Press "Calibrate"
2. **Empty calibration**: Remove all weight from scale platform ‚Üí Press OK
3. **Weight calibration**: 
   - Place known weight on scale (e.g., coffee mug with water)
   - Use +/- buttons to adjust displayed value to match actual weight
   - Press OK to complete

**Tip**: A coffee mug with water makes ideal calibration weight - weigh it on kitchen scale first.

### Auto-Tune Motor Response

The auto-tune feature models your grinder's motor response behavior by measuring the physical lag between relay activation and grounds production. This accounts for hardware variations like voltage differences (110V vs 220V), relay types (solid-state vs mechanical), and burr inertia across different grinder models. The default 50ms value works well for most setups, but if you experience unreliable pulse corrections or want to minimize coffee waste through hardware-specific optimization, run auto-tune via **Settings ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Auto-Tune Motor Response**. The 1-2 minute calibration process finds the minimum reliable pulse duration for your specific hardware and saves it automatically.

### Diagnostics System

The system includes comprehensive load cell health monitoring accessible via **Settings ‚Üí Diagnostics**. A warning icon (‚ö†) appears in the top-right corner when diagnostics are active - tap it to navigate directly to the diagnostics page.

**Diagnostic Types:**
1. **Load Cell Not Calibrated** - Appears until calibration is completed via Settings ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Calibrate
2. **Sustained Noise** - Triggers after 60 seconds of excessive noise; clears after 120 seconds of acceptable levels
3. **Mechanical Instability** - Detects sudden weight drops during grinding (3+ events); auto-resets on next grind or via manual reset

**Displayed Values:**
- **Motor Latency** - Current motor response latency in milliseconds (default: 50ms, or calibrated value from auto-tune)
- **Calibration Factor** - Load cell calibration factor from Settings ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Calibrate

**Noise Floor Diagnostics:**

Access via **Settings ‚Üí Diagnostics ‚Üí Noise Floor**.

**Three values displayed:**
1. **Standard Deviation (grams)** - Noise level in calibrated weight units
2. **Standard Deviation (ADC)** - Raw sensor noise values
3. **Noise Level Indicator** - Shows if noise will cause slow taring (>2s) or timeouts

**Important:** Noise diagnostics require prior calibration as they're based on calibrated gram values. High noise readings indicate wiring issues (check shield connection, use shorter wire leads). Read diagnostics in a stable, vibration-free environment for accurate assessment.

## üß† Algorithm Details

### Grinding Algorithm

The system uses a **zero-shot learning algorithm** requiring no prior knowledge or manually tuned variables. It instantly adapts to changes in temperature, humidity, grinding coarseness, bean type, and hardware characteristics.

**Multi-Phase Approach:**

1. **Initialization & Taring Phase**
   - Automatic tare on grind button press
   - 30-second timeout from grind start to completion
   - Noise-adaptive settling detection

2. **Predictive Phase**
   - Learns flow rate and motor-to-cup latency (relay + motor inertia + burr spin-up)
   - Predicts when to stop motor based on measured flow and coast characteristics
   - Target: barely undershoot target weight (overshoot is unrecoverable)
   - Uses runtime-configurable motor response latency (30-200ms, default 50ms)

3. **Pulse Correction Phase**
   - Conservative pulse duration calculation using 95th percentile flow rate
   - Bounded pulses respect hardware-specific motor response latency
   - Pulses range from motor latency minimum to latency + 225ms maximum
   - Mechanical instability detection (3+ sudden weight drops triggers diagnostic)
   - Repeats until target ¬± tolerance reached

4. **Time Mode Additional Pulses**
   - Dedicated `TIME_ADDITIONAL_PULSE` phase for post-completion grinding
   - 100ms fixed pulse duration
   - Split-button UI: OK + PULSE buttons on completion screen

**Motor Response Latency Model:**

The motor response latency represents the physical system lag between relay activation and grounds production. This value is hardware-specific and accounts for:
- Relay closure time (solid-state vs mechanical relays)
- Motor inertia (110V vs 220V motors)
- Burr spin-up characteristics (different grinder models/designs)

The latency value is automatically calibrated via **Auto-Tune Motor Response** (Settings ‚Üí Tools) using binary search with statistical verification, or uses a safe 50ms default. This enables universal grinder compatibility without firmware modifications.

**Key Features:**
- Noise-resistant through multi-modal load cell measurement (instant, smoothed, filtered)
- Hardware-adaptive pulse control via runtime motor latency
- Conservative approach: undershoots target, then corrects with bounded pulses
- Mechanical instability detection with hysteresis and persistence
- 30-second grind timeout protection with user acknowledgment requirement

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Will this modification work on grinders other than the Eureka Mignon Specialita?**

See the comprehensive **[Grinder Compatibility Matrix](GRINDER_COMPATIBILITY.md)** for detailed compatibility information across different grinder models, including confirmed compatible models, adaptation requirements, and installation methods.

**Can I use this to grind directly into a portafilter instead of a dosing cup?**

Yes, but requires modifications: use 1kg load cell (vs 0.3kg) for better accuracy with heavier portafilters. Design and 3D print custom portafilter holder mounting to load cell. The dosing cup holder design serves as reference for portafilter adapter.
