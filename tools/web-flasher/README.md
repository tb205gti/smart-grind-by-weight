## Development

The web flasher is automatically deployed via GitHub Pages when pushed to main branch.

### Local Testing

**Quick Start (Recommended):**
```bash
# From the tools directory
python3 start-webflasher.py

# If port 8000 is busy, you'll be prompted to kill the process
# Use a custom port
python3 start-webflasher.py --port 3000
```

The script will automatically:
- Check if the port is available
- Prompt to kill any conflicting process
- Start the server and display the URL
- Handle cleanup on exit

**Manual Start:**
```bash
# Serve locally (required for Web Bluetooth HTTPS requirement)
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory tools/web-flasher
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

**Note:** While the production site requires HTTPS for Web Bluetooth, `localhost` is an exception and works with plain HTTP.

## Security

- All communications use Web Bluetooth's built-in security
- Firmware is downloaded directly from GitHub releases
- No credentials or keys stored locally
